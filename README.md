<!-- The following describes the dataset variables:

·      CRIM - per capita crime rate by town

·      ZN - proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.

·      INDUS - proportion of non-retail business acres per town.

·      CHAS - Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)

·      NOX - nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)

·      RM - average number of rooms per dwelling

·      AGE - proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940

·      DIS - weighted distances to five Boston employment centres

·      RAD - index of accessibility to radial highways

·      TAX - full-value property-tax rate per $10,000

·      PTRATIO - pupil-teacher ratio by town

·      LSTAT - % lower status of the population

·      MEDV - Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000's -->
<!-- **Project Scenario: **
Is there a significant difference in the median value of houses bounded by the Charles river or not?

Is there a difference in median values of houses of each proportion of owner-occupied units built before 1940?

Can we conclude that there is no relationship between Nitric oxide concentrations and the proportion of non-retail business acres per town?

What is the impact of an additional weighted distance to the five Boston employment centres on the median value of owner-occupied homes?
